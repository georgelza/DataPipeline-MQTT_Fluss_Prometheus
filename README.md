# Building a IoT Source via MQTT Broker to Apache Flink/Fluss Pipeline for IoT based payload.

Work in Progress... NOT COMPLETE.

## Overview

This originally started as a simple idea, create a IoT JSON packaged payload, publish it to a **MQTT Broker**, consume using a connector into Flink and then down to Fluss and down to the lakehouse configured Paimon storage onto the configured storage technology, which was originally planned as S3.

But we tripped and ended in the proverbial rabbit hole, again, nothing new.

The numbers below maps to the `<root>/devlab#` directories

1.  We will create the IoT specific payload as shown below, post it onto 3 x **MQTT Brokers**, consuming the messages using the following source connector.

- [davidfantasy - flink-connector-mqtt](https://github.com/davidfantasy/flink-connector-mqtt) (Preferred) or 

from our **Apache Flink** cluster and ingest the data into our `hive_catalog.iot.factory_iot_#`  (each table mimicing a siteId) tables. We will then insert the data into our `fluss_catalog.iot.*` selecting from the `hive_catalog.iot.*` tables.

NOTE: This is an example connector... Do not assume that it is large enterprise producion ready.

2.  Same as #1, but persisted onto **HDFS**.

3.  Same as #1, but persisted onto **AWS S3** hosted on a **MinIO** Container, ye the actual original idea for this blog, or was that series, but def a Rabbbit hole.


### For sections devlab #1, 2 & 3

We will publish the payloads generated by the 6 factories onto 3 seperate **MQTT Brokers** based on the regional locatation/distribution, namely North, South and East.


### Flink Catalog


We're still using our **Apache Hive Metastore** as catalog with a **PostgreSQL** database for backend storage.
See below for version information.

## To run the project.

### See various configuration settings and passwords in:

0. devlab#/docker_compose.yml

1. .pwd in app_mqttiot# in siteX.sh

2. devlab#/.env

3. devlab#/conf/hive.env

4. devlab#/conf/hive-site.xml

### Download containers and libraries

1. cd infrastructure

2. make pullall

3. make buildall


### Build various containers

1. cd devlab#

2. ./getlibs.sh

3. make build

4. Slight Digress, At this stage we need to configure our Mosquito Brokers. See below.


### Mosquito Access control

[Authentication methods](https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/)

I decided to behave an enable authentification on the MQTT Broker, to accomplish this we need a password file with a username and password contained. To prepare for this follow the following steps.

Start by executing `<root>/devlab#/make run`

This will start the stack, now execute the below.

Now execute
    `docker compose exec mqtt_broker_north /bin/sh`

Followby by executing inside the container.

    `mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/password_file mqtt_dev`

    I used `abfr24` as password, this will match the `.pws` in `<root>/app_mqttiot1/.pws`

First make sure the `<root>/devlab#/conf/mqtt/<east/north/south>/mosquitto.conf` contain the below

North
```shell
    persistence true
    listener 1883
    persistence_location /mosquitto/data
    log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
    password_file /mosquitto/config/password_file
```

South
```shell
    persistence true
    listener 1884
    persistence_location /mosquitto/data
    log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
    password_file /mosquitto/config/password_file
```

East
```shell
    persistence true
    listener 1885
    persistence_location /mosquitto/data
    log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
    password_file /mosquitto/config/password_file
```

Now execute `make down`, once the stack is stopped execute the below.

    Copy the files located into the `<root>/devlab#/conf/mqtt/north/` to `../south/` & `../east/` directories.


I use both MQTT Explorer and MQTT.fx to see whats happening on MQTT Brokers.


4. Now, to run it please read README.md in `<root>/devlab#/README.md` file.

### Flink Libraries

As I am always travelling while writing these blog's and did not want to pull the libraries on every build I decided to downlaod them once into the below directory and then mount them into container. Just a different way less bandwidth and also slightly faster builds.

The `devlab#/conf/flink/lib/*` directories will house our Java libraries required by our Flink stack. 

Normally I'd include these in the Dockerfile as part of the image build, but during development it's easier if we place them here and then mount the directories into the containers at run time via our `docker-compose.yml` file inside the volume specification for the flink-* services.

This makes it simpler to add/remove libraries as we simply have to restart the flink container and not rebuild it.

Additionally, as the `jobmanager`, `taskmanager` use the same libraries doing it tis way allows us to use this one set, thus also reducing the disk space and the container image size.

The various files are downloaded by executing the `getlibs.sh` file located in the `devlab#/` directory.
